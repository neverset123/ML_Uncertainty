        "\n",
        "Deep Ensembles are sets of Deep NNs (DNNs) which are tasked with producing multiple predictions for the same datapoint. The rationale is that the inherent randomness contained within the initialization and training process will cause the network to find different sets of parameters solving the same task, while producing possibly (widely) different responses to areas of high uncertainty (e.g., out-of-distribution data), thus finding an implicit way to estimate uncertainty even with deterministic models.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this specific lab, we will produce ensemble of two-headed DNNs, one of which estimates the mean value, and the other estimates the variance; thus, the training process will vary, since we will have to use the Gaussian Negative Log-Likelihood loss instead of the canonical MSE we have insofar utilized.\n",

        "\n",
        "VI takes a different approach to training BNNs.\n",
        "Instead of using tricks to modify deterministic layers into stochastic ones, it uses a full Bayesian approach, which consists in defining a _prior distribution_ on the parameters $\\Theta \\sim P(\\Theta)$ and computing a _posterior distribution_ $P(\\Theta\\vert \\mathcal{D})$, which equates to an _update in knowledge_ concerning the parameters $\\Theta$ following the observed data $\\mathcal{D}$.\n",
        "The information conveyed by the data, which showcases the empirical \"plausibility\" of the data according to the current set of parameters is the _likelihood_ $P(\\mathcal{D}\\vert \\Theta)$, which is usually the ideological \"driver\" toward the deterministic ML models: optimize parameters to maximize the likelihood.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using Bayes' theorem, we can find a rule for updating the prior distribution according to the evidence brought on by the likelihood:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "P(\\Theta \\vert \\mathcal{D}) = \\frac{P(\\mathcal{D}\\vert \\Theta)\\cdot P{\\Theta}}{P(\\mathcal{D})}\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "The hard part of the computation above is the denominator, which would require to either\n",
        "* know the data generating process (which is usually unknown in ML applications), or\n",
        "* calculate a very computationally-intensive integral, which obtains $P(\\mathcal{D})$ from _marginalization_ of the likelihood.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are several ways to solve this problem in an approximate way, VI being one of them.\n",
        "The foundational idea is to find an approximation of the posterior, which we call _variational posterior_ ($q$), from which we can sample the parameters of the model and obtain a prediction.\n",
        "The variational posterior is trained by trying to _minimize_ the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between itself and the true posterior.\n",
        "\n",
        "Given the unknown nature of the true posterior, the KL divergence is approximated by the following loss function:\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\\mathcal{L} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left[ \\log \\underbrace{q(\\theta_i)}_{\\text{var. post.}} - \\log \\underbrace{P(\\theta_i)}_{\\text{prior}} - \\log \\underbrace{P(\\mathcal{D}\\vert \\theta_i)}_{\\text{likelihood}} \\right]\n",
        "$$\n",
        "The $\\theta_i$'s in the formula are samples from the variational posterior: the loss is hence a mean over multiple of these samples.\n",
        "\n",
        "The immediate architectural difference between previously seen NNs is that we now have to **explicitly** represent the distribution $q$ for each of the layers. The most common choice is to use a Gaussian distribution, which requires the layers to be parameterized by a mean $\\mu$ and a variance $\\Sigma$, which is usually a diagonal matrix (→ each parameter of the layer is parameterized by a scalar mean and a scalar variance).\n",
        "A backward pass would calculate the gradient for all of these parameters: hence, at each step of (S)GD we update both the mean and variance.\n",
        "Note the following:\n",
        "* To allow for the differentiability of the loss function w.r.t. the parameters $\\mu$ and $\\Sigma$, the sampling process is replaced by the _reparameterization trick_: instead of sampling directly from $q$, we take $\\mu$ and add to it $\\Sigma$ times a random sample from a standard Gaussian. Since the source of randomness is independent from $\\mu, \\Sigma$, it gets eliminated in the differentiation process and we can train the parameters via GD.\n",
        "* Since GD could cause the values of the diagonals of $\\Sigma$ to fall below 0, we elect a vector $\\rho$ as a replacement for the training process, and get $\\text{diag}(\\Sigma) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\rho}} = \\text{softplus}(\\rho)$. The softplus function transforms a real number into a positive number, thus ensuring that the diagonal of the variance matrix will always contain positive scalars.\n",
        "\n",
        "The [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.05424.pdf) introducing this type of VI-based training calls this process BayesByBackprop.\n",
        "Its authors propose adopting a mixture-of-Gaussians prior with 2 component.\n",
        "These components have 0 mean and two different diagonal variance matrices $\\Sigma_1 = \\sigma_1 I$ and $\\Sigma_2 = \\sigma_2 I$, with $\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}^+$.\n",
        "The prevalence of component 1 w.r.t. component 2 is regulated by a scalar $pi\\in[0,1]$.\n",
        "For each parameter $\\theta^{(j)} \\in \\Theta$, we have the following prior\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "P(\\theta^{(j)}) = \\pi [\\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma_1)(\\theta^{(j)})] + (1-\\pi) [\\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma_2)(\\theta^{(j)})].\n",
